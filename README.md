# Digit_RBKD
Rigid Body Kinematics and Dynamics in c++ for robot Digit from Agility Robotics. 

Why not Pinocchio or RBDL? This way I gain more understanding of the underlying [algorithms](https://royfeatherstone.org/spatial/v2/) while making it specifically suited for my control code down the line. 

<font color='red'>**This implementation is 9.7 times slower than Pinocchio but has pedagogical value**</font>
